# BUNCO! With TypeScript!

This respoistory contains representative solutions for a game of Bunco written
in TypeScript. This image shows the UML Static Class diagram for the implemented
solution.

# Two Solutions!

That's right! You can see two solutions in this repository!

## Branch: `in-typescript`
This branch shows the solution in normal, plain-old object-oriented TypeScript.
While that may sound boring, I assure you that it's not.

## Branch: `with-rxjs`
This branch shows the same solution built in the reactive paradigm. So, there's
that hotness available to you, too.
